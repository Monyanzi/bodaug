      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Discover the story behind the iconic street food that fuels Uganda, a delicious and clever play on "rolled eggs."</p>

      <div className="prose max-w-none"> {/* Using a prose class for typography defaults */}

        <p>Across Uganda, from the bustling streets of Kampala to quiet village trading posts, there is one sound that promises a quick, delicious, and satisfying meal: the sizzle of eggs on a hot plate. This is the sound of the Rolex being born. Far from a luxury timepiece, the Ugandan Rolex is the country's undisputed king of street food‚Äîa warm chapati embracing a savory omelette filled with fresh tomatoes and onions. It‚Äôs a cultural unifier, enjoyed by students, business people, and travelers alike. It‚Äôs not just food; it‚Äôs a piece of Ugandan identity.</p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Anatomy of a Perfect Rolex üç≥</h3>
        <p>At its heart, the Rolex is beautifully simple, but the magic is in the combination of fresh, hot ingredients, cooked right before your eyes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Foundation (The Chapati):</strong> A soft, flaky, and slightly chewy flatbread, cooked to a perfect golden-brown on a griddle. It's the vessel that holds everything together.</li>
          <li><strong>The Heart (The Eggs):</strong> Two or three eggs are whisked and fried into a thin, wide omelette. This isn't a fluffy French omelette; it's a robust, flavorful sheet of egg that becomes the savory core.</li>
          <li><strong>The Crunch & Flavour (The Vegetables):</strong> Finely chopped fresh ingredients are mixed into the eggs or added on top before rolling. The holy trinity is: Tomatoes, Onions, and Cabbage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Theatre of the Street: How It's Made</h3>
        <p>Watching a Rolex vendor‚Äîor "Rolex guy"‚Äîis pure street theatre. The process is a rapid, mesmerizing dance of skill and efficiency.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The Sizzle:</strong> A ladle of oil hits the hot flat-top griddle with a satisfying sizzle.</li>
          <li><strong>The Pour:</strong> The whisked egg and vegetable mixture is poured onto the griddle, spreading out into a thin circle.</li>
          <li><strong>The Flip:</strong> With a flick of the wrist and a wide spatula, the omelette is expertly flipped.</li>
          <li><strong>The Union:</strong> A ready-made chapati is placed on top of the cooking omelette, warming it through and fusing the two together.</li>
          <li><strong>The Roll:</strong> The entire combination is lifted from the griddle, placed on a piece of paper, and rolled tightly into a delicious, portable cylinder. It‚Äôs handed to you piping hot, ready to eat on the go.</li>
        </ol>
