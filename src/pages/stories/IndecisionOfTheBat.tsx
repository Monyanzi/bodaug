                    Long, long ago, a great war erupted between the Animals of the Land and the Birds of the Air. The Lion commanded the beasts, and the mighty Eagle led the birds. The fighting was fierce, shaking the forests and darkening the skies. In this time of conflict lived the Bat, a strange creature with the furry body of a mouse but the leathery wings of a bird.

                    Those who refuse to choose a side in times of conflict out of self-interest will ultimately be rejected by all and live in shame.

                    Being a cunning opportunist, he decided to wait and see who was winning. On the first day, the armies of the Lion were victorious. That evening, the Bat flew to the Lionâ€™s camp. "I am with you!" he declared, puffing out his chest to show his furry body and sharp teeth. "I am a beast of the land!" The Lion, pleased, welcomed him.

                    But the next day, the Eagle rallied his forces and attacked from the sky, driving the animals back. That night, the Bat quietly slipped away and flew to the Eagle's roost. "My true brothers!" he squeaked, spreading his wings wide. "Look at these wings! I am one of you, a creature of the air!" The Eagle, suspicious but needing more fighters, allowed him to join.

                  For days, the Bat switched his allegiance back and forth. Finally, the wisest of the animals and birds grew tired of the endless fighting and made a lasting peace. As the two sides gathered to celebrate, the Bat flew confidently into the centre of the clearing. But a silence fell over the crowd.

                  The Lion looked at him with contempt. "You are no beast," he growled. The Eagle glared down from his perch. "And you are no bird," he screeched. Both sides, the animals and the birds, turned their backs on him. Cast out and despised for his disloyalty, the Bat was overcome with a shame so deep he could no longer bear the light of day.
