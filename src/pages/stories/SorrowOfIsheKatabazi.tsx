                    There once lived a man in Ankole named Ishe-Katabazi, whose strength was as great as his love for his family. But a shadow fell upon his house: one by one, his children and beloved wife were taken by sickness and vanished from the world of the living. Mad with grief, Ishe-Katabazi swore an oath to wage war on Death itself.

                    He journeyed to the edge of the world and found the path leading down to okuzimu, the underworld. It was a place of shadows and silence, ruled by the king of the dead. Ishe-Katabazi stormed the kingâ€™s throne and demanded the return of his family.

                  Bound by his word, the king agreed to release the family, but with one final condition: "You may lead them out, but you must not look back until you are fully in the world of the living. If you do, they will be mine forever." Ishe-Katabazi began the long climb, his family following silently behind him. He could hear their footsteps on the dusty path, a sound of impossible joy.

                  He felt the warmth of the sun on his face as he stepped back into the world of light. But in his moment of relief, he heard the footsteps of his children, but not his wife's. Overcome by a sudden, terrible fear that she had been left behind, his love and doubt overwhelmed his discipline. He turned. He saw his children right behind him, but his wife was only halfway out of the shadow of the underworld. At his glance, they all dissolved like smoke, pulled back into darkness, lost to him forever.
