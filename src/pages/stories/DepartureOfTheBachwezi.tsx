                    There was a time when the lands of Kitara were ruled not by men, but by beings of smoke and light called the Bachwezi. They were tall and fair-skinned, and their reign under their last king, Wamara, was a golden age of peace and prosperity. But even the brightest day must surrender to dusk.

                    Even the most divine power is impermanent, and all great eras must eventually yield to the inevitable march of time and fate.

                    The end of their time began not with a war, but with a series of omens. Wamaraâ€™s favourite cow, Bihogo, grew sick and died, an event that sent a tremor of fear through the court. Wamara summoned his diviners, who read the entrails and cast the cowries.

                    Their faces were grim. "The signs are dark, oh great king," they announced. "Your reign is ending. A new people, dull and dark, will come from the north to rule in your place." Wamara, in his pride, refused to believe it and commanded great rituals to be performed, but every attempt to reverse the prophecy failed. The magic of the Bachwezi was fading.

                  Seeing that fate was a river that could not be dammed, Wamara accepted the truth. He gathered the Bachwezi chiefs from all corners of the empire. He stood before them, not as a defeated king, but as a ruler guiding his people into eternity. "Our time in the world of men is over," he declared. "We will not be conquered. We will not die. We will simply depart."

                  He led his people on a great procession, leaving behind their royal drums and earthly possessions. They walked south towards the great lakes of the land. As they reached the shores, they did not stop. They walked directly into the water, their shimmering forms dissolving into the mist rising from the surface until not a single one was left. They did not die; they withdrew from the world.

                Their spirits became the guardians of the crater lakes and lonely hills. Soon after, as foretold, the Babiito clan arrived from the north to find a throne empty and a kingdom waiting, built upon the legend of the demigods who walked into water.
